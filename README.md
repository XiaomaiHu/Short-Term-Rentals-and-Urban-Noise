# Short-Term Rentals and Urban Noise



## üîç Background

In recent years, New York City has faced growing concerns about neighborhood noise, housing insecurity, and the social impact of short-term rentals. With nearly 5 million adults reporting hearing loss and ringing in their ears, while 1 in 5 residents frequently disturbed by noise at home, the city‚Äôs soundscape has become a significant public health and quality of life issue. Additionally, New York City welcomed 62.2 million visitors in 2023, further contributing to urban noise levels.
The rapid growth of the short-term rental market has changed the acoustic environment of urban neighborhoods, especially the cities like New York where tourism, housing, and density intersect. New York City residents have made numerous complaints that Airbnb short-term renters negatively impact the environment of their communities, particularly with regard to neighborhood noise. Platforms like Airbnb provide new economic opportunities for property owners and tourists but also raise issues about community environmental quality. 


To address this, the city enacted **Local Law 18** in 2023:
- Requiring short-term rental hosts to register with the Office of Special Enforcement
- Banning transactions for unregistered listings
- Enforcing platform compliance (e.g., Airbnb, Vrbo)


## Research Question

**Is there a correlation between the reduction in Airbnb short-term rentals and changes in 311 noise complaints following the implementation of Local Law 18?**
